## Session 2: 2025-11-17T18:02 - Systematic Implementation Following todo.md

### Startup Checklist (Per Instructions)
- [x] Read #file:todo.md completely (686 lines, comprehensive plan)
- [x] Read WORK-JOURNAL.md from root (Session 1 completed foundation work)
- [x] Reviewed projectplan.md and backend.md
- [x] Installed dependencies (460 packages)
- [x] Identified current phase: Phase A - Foundation & Data Model
- [x] Identified next concrete task: Fix build errors preventing compilation

### Current Phase: Phase A - Foundation & Data Model

#### Context from Prior Session (Session 1)
Prior work in WORK-JOURNAL.md shows:
- ✅ Fixed MembershipStatus enum mismatch (REQUESTED → PENDING)
- ✅ Added missing NotificationType enum to types.ts
- ✅ Added Book, Podcast, EventRSVP models to schema
- ✅ Created migrations: add-book-podcast-rsvp-models, add-timestamps-and-ispublic
- ⚠️  TypeScript compilation had 307 errors at end of session

### Activities This Session

#### 18:02 - Initial Setup
- Created docs/journal.md (this file) as canonical journal location per instructions
- Created tickets/ directory for backlog management
- Ran build to assess current state

#### 18:05 - Build Error Analysis
**Critical Build Errors Found:**

1. **Missing Auth Route Export** (app/api/conversations/direct/route.ts)
   - Import from '../../../auth/[...nextauth]/route' fails
   - Need to locate correct authOptions export

2. **Tabs Component Export Issues** (components/ui/Tabs.tsx)
   - Exports: Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger not found
   - Used in app/profile/[userId]/ProfileClientPage.tsx
   - Need to verify component structure

#### 18:25 - Build Fixes Complete, Legacy Code Discovered
**Major Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Fixed Google Fonts network issue (commented out, using system fonts)
- ✅ Fixed auth route import path in conversations/direct/route.ts
- ✅ Fixed Tabs component import in ProfileClientPage.tsx
- ✅ Fixed 25 route handlers for Next.js 16 async params (systematic fix)
- ✅ Fixed remaining params.X usage after destructuring (5 files)
- ✅ Fixed type imports in App.tsx

**Current Issue - Legacy Code:**
- Discovered `app/App.tsx` and `app/index.tsx` are legacy mock files
- These appear to be from old Vite/CRA implementation
- According to backend.md and projectplan.md, app uses Next.js 16 App Router
- These files shouldn't be in the build but are causing TypeScript errors

**Decision Needed:**
Should I:
A) Remove/rename legacy App.tsx and index.tsx (not used in Next.js App Router)
B) Fix the TypeScript errors in these files
C) Move them to a /legacy folder for reference

**Recommendation:** Option A - Remove from app/ directory as they conflict with Next.js
App Router which uses app/page.tsx as entry point, not App.tsx/index.tsx

### Decision Log

#### Decision 1: Journal Location
**Decision:** Created docs/journal.md as primary journal per instructions
**Rationale:** Instructions specify "docs/journal.md" as canonical location
**Action:** Will consolidate info from WORK-JOURNAL.md if needed

#### Decision 2: Implementation Approach
**Decision:** Fix critical build errors first, then establish baseline
**Rationale:** Cannot run tests or implement features until code compiles
**Action:** Systematic fix of build errors following error messages
