# Temple Hardening & Cleanup TODO

This document lists all known work required to bring Temple from “first implementation” to a robust, maintainable, production-ready platform.

It is written for a *second team* taking over the app. Treat this as the living project plan, not just a backlog dump.

---

## Current Status (Updated 2025-11-18 Session 8)

**Phase:** Phase B – Auth, Sessions, Permissions (COMPLETE) ✅

**Recent Sessions:**
- Session 1-2: Fixed async params migration, initial cleanup
- Session 3: Discovered type system issues (Ticket #0002)
- Session 4: Type system fixes, comprehensive error analysis ✅
- Session 5: Applied systematic async/await fixes (20+ files) ✅
- Session 6: Final build fixes, test baseline established ✅
- Session 7: Data seeding verification, schema alignment verification ✅
- Session 8: **Phase B Implementation - Auth, Sessions, Permissions** ✅

**Build Status:**
- ✅ Turbopack compilation: SUCCESS
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: SUCCESS (0 errors)
- ✅ Next.js production build: SUCCESS
- ✅ Dev server: Tested and working
- ✅ Test suite: Baseline maintained (54/61 passing - 88.5%)

**Active Tickets:**
- #0001: Async Params Migration - **RESOLVED** ✅
- #0002: Type System Alignment - **OPEN** (12 temporary type casts documented, deferred per plan)

**Test Suite Baseline:**
- Total: 61 tests
- Passing: 54 (88.5%)
- Failing: 6 (auth-related 401s - known test framework limitation)
- Skipped: 1

**Phase A Completion Status:**
- ✅ Section 1: Architecture clarified and documented
- ✅ Section 2.1: Schema alignment verified - all models present
- ✅ Section 2.2: JSON fields defined (TenantSettings, permissions)
- ✅ Section 2.3: Soft deletes implemented (isDeleted, deletedAt fields)
- ✅ Section 2.4: Data seeding COMPLETE - comprehensive seed file verified
- ✅ Section 2.5: Indexes in place for common access patterns
- ⚠️  Ticket #0002: Type system alignment deferred (minimal changes approach)

**Phase B Completion Status:**
- ✅ Section 3.1: NextAuth configuration verified and working
- ✅ Section 3.2: Registration flows complete with Zod validation
- ✅ Section 3.3: Login, logout, session management working; /api/auth/me enhanced
- ⏭️ Section 3.4: Password reset (SKIPPED - lower priority)
- ⏭️ Section 3.5: Impersonation (SKIPPED - can be done later, infrastructure exists)
- ✅ Section 4.1: Permission system centralized with comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Section 4.2: Tenant resolution and isolation fully implemented
- ✅ Section 4.3: UI-level permission enforcement fixed in TenantLayout

**Key Decisions:**
- Using minimal type casts (`as any`) with TODO comments for Ticket #0002
- Prisma types as source of truth (removed duplicate enums)
- Legacy Vite files moved to legacy/ folder
- Comprehensive seed data already exists and working
- Test failures due to HTTP-only cookie limitation (not auth bugs)

**Next Sprint Focus:**
- **Phase C - Tenant Features (Content, Events, Messaging, Donations)**
- OR continue with API route implementation (Section 5)
- OR address Ticket #0002 type system improvements



## 0. Sprints, Stories & Phases

Use this section to slice the work so we “drink one sip at a time” instead of boiling the ocean.

### 0.1 Phases (High-Level)

- **Phase A – Foundation & Data Model**
  - Lock down `schema.prisma`, align with `types.ts`, implement seeding, and remove remaining mock-only assumptions.
- **Phase B – Auth, Sessions, Permissions**
  - NextAuth wiring, impersonation model, per-tenant permissions, and consistent access control from API down to UI.
- **Phase C – Tenant Features (Content, Events, Messaging, Donations)**
  - Implement all `/api/tenants/*` feature routes, migrate UI to real APIs, and cover critical happy-path flows.
- **Phase D – Admin, Notifications, Community Features**
  - Admin console, notifications, volunteer/small groups, prayer wall, resource center.
- **Phase E – Hardening, Observability, DX**
  - Error handling, logging, metrics, testing strategy, dev ergonomics.

### 0.2 Sprint Breakdown (Example)

Use 1–2 week sprints. Adjust scope to the team size.

- **Sprint 1 – Database & Seeded Sandbox**
  - Finalize Prisma models and enums.
  - Implement `prisma/seed.ts` with a “golden” test tenant, super admin, standard user, and sample content.
  - Make `npm run db:reset && npm run db:seed` idempotent.
- **Sprint 2 – Auth & Basic Tenant Access**
  - Finish NextAuth config and credentials provider.
  - Implement `POST /api/auth/register`, `GET /api/auth/me`.
  - Implement basic tenant listing and “join tenant” happy path for a seeded tenant.
- **Sprint 3 – Control Panel & Membership**
  - Wire Control Panel tabs to real APIs.
  - Implement membership CRUD routes and permission checks.
  - Cover key flows with tests.
- **Sprint 4 – Content & Events**
  - Posts, media (sermons/podcasts/books), events & RSVPs.
  - Ensure tenant home, posts, and events pages are fully functional against the backend.
- **Sprint 5 – Messaging & Notifications**
  - DM and tenant chat API wiring, unread counts.
  - Notification flows for DM, membership, announcements.
- **Sprint 6 – Donations, Contact, Community**
  - Donations, contact submissions, volunteer needs, small groups, prayer wall, resources.
- **Sprint 7 – Hardening & Production Readiness**
  - Error boundaries, logging, security passes, load testing as needed.

### 0.3 User Story Templates

Use consistent story templates to keep acceptance criteria clear.

- **Feature user story (example – membership):**
  - *As a* tenant admin
  - *I want* to approve or reject membership requests from a queue
  - *So that* only appropriate members gain access to my community
  - **Acceptance criteria:**
    - Given there are `PENDING` membership requests, when I visit the Control Panel → “Membership & Moderation” tab, I see a list ordered by date.
    - When I click “Approve”, the membership becomes `APPROVED`, the user is notified, and the member appears in the Members list.
    - When I click “Reject”, the membership becomes `REJECTED`, the user is notified, and the member does *not* appear in the Members list.
    - All actions are recorded in `AuditLog` with `ActionType.MEMBERSHIP_STATUS_UPDATED`.

- **API story (example – posts):**
  - *As a* API consumer (Next.js server components and route handlers)
  - *I want* `GET /api/tenants/{tenantId}/posts` to return a well-typed, paginated list of posts
  - *So that* all UI variants of tenant posts can rely on a single source of truth
  - **Acceptance criteria:**
    - API returns `200` and an array of `{ id, title, body, type, isPublished, publishedAt, author: { id, displayName } }` when called by an authenticated member.
    - Anonymous users only see posts allowed by `TenantSettings.visitorVisibility.posts`.
    - When tenant is soft-deleted or disabled, API returns `404`.

- **Database story (example – EventRSVP):**
  - *As a* developer
  - *I want* an `EventRSVP` model and supporting indexes
  - *So that* RSVP logic is efficient and consistent across tenants
  - **Acceptance criteria:**
    - `schema.prisma` contains `model EventRSVP { id String @id @default(cuid()) userId String eventId String status RSVPStatus ... }` and a unique constraint on `(userId, eventId)`.
    - `npx prisma migrate dev` succeeds and seeds a small set of `EventRSVP` rows linked to existing events.
    - `getRSVPsForEvent(eventId)` returns rows in O(1) query count and is covered by tests.

> Adjust these templates per team norms, but always keep **who / what / why + acceptance criteria**.

## 1. Architecture & Migration Strategy

This document assumes:

- Next.js 16 (App Router, route handlers, server components)
- NextAuth for auth
- Prisma + SQLite for dev (future Postgres)
- TypeScript strict
- The spec in `projectplan.md` and the backend playbook in `backend.md` are the source of truth.

Use this as a master checklist. Each bullet should either become a ticket or be checked off explicitly.

---

## 1. Architecture & Migration Strategy

### 1.1 Clarify the canonical architecture

- Replace outdated references to `seed-data.ts`, purely in-memory store, and `App.tsx`-managed global state in docs:
  - Update `projectplan.md` to describe real Prisma/NextAuth-based architecture.
  - Update `backend.md` to reflect actual folder layout (`app/api`, `lib`, `prisma`, etc.).
- Document the new layering:
  - **Route handlers / server components** → **service/logic layer** (in `lib` or `services`) → **Prisma**.
  - Make it clear that components must not call Prisma directly.
- Decide and document where “services” live:
  - E.g., `lib/services/authService.ts`, `tenantService.ts`, `contentService.ts`, etc.
  - Each service exposes functions used by route handlers and server components.

### 1.2 Remove legacy mock-only assumptions

- Search for and remove any remaining references to:
  - `seed-data.ts` / localStorage persistence.
  - Old `App.tsx` stateful multi-tenant shell.
  - Legacy components described in docs but no longer accurate (e.g., mock-only `TenantLayout` flows).
- Ensure all data access in UI is through:
  - `getServerSession` + service calls in server components or route handlers.
  - `fetch('/api/...')` or server actions, not direct imports of data-layer functions from components.

### 1.3 Define migration completion criteria

- List concrete “done” criteria:
  - No imports of `prisma` from React components.
  - All domains (auth, tenants, membership, content, events, donations, messaging, notifications, admin tools) are Prisma-backed.
  - All “TODO: Implement X” functions in `lib/data.ts` are either implemented or removed.
  - All tests in `test-suite/` either pass or are explicitly tagged/skipped with rationale.

---

## 2. Data & Prisma

### 2.1 Align conceptual models with Prisma schema

- Compare `types.ts` vs `schema.prisma`:
  - Ensure all major concepts in `projectplan.md` exist in schema:
    - `User`, `UserProfile`, `UserPrivacySettings`, `AccountSettings`.
    - `Tenant`, `TenantBranding`, `TenantSettings` (including feature toggles).
    - Membership: `UserTenantMembership`, `UserTenantRole`.
    - Content: `Post`, `MediaItem` (sermons, podcasts), `Book` equivalent if separate.
    - Events: `Event`, `EventRSVP` (spec says RSVP is missing in mock).
    - Messaging: `Conversation`, `ConversationParticipant`, `ChatMessage`/`Message`.
    - Notifications, `NotificationPreference`.
    - Donations: `DonationSettings`, `DonationRecord`.
    - Contact submissions.
    - Audit logs and impersonation.
  - Add missing Prisma models where required by the spec (`EventRSVP`, possibly others).
- Ensure enums match:
  - `TenantRole`, `TenantRoleType`, `MembershipStatus`, `CommunityPostType`, `CommunityPostStatus`, etc.
  - Align Prisma enums and TypeScript enums to avoid mapping bugs.

### 2.2 Normalize JSON fields and shapes

- Identify all JSON fields:
  - `Tenant.permissions`.
  - `TenantSettings.visitorVisibility`, `donationSettings`, `liveStreamSettings`.
- Define a single source of truth for JSON shapes:
  - Add TypeScript types describing each JSON block.
  - Use Zod (or similar) schemas to validate these before use.
- Implement guards:
  - Whenever JSON is read from Prisma, validate and normalize (e.g., fill in missing keys with defaults).
  - Fail fast on invalid JSON with clear error logging and safe fallback.

### 2.3 Soft deletes and consistency

- Decide on soft-delete vs hard-delete strategy:
  - `ChatMessage` currently uses `isDeleted`.
  - Spec suggests `deletedAt` on content/event models.
- Implement a consistent approach:
  - For `Post`, `Event`, `MediaItem`, `ChatMessage` (and others as needed), either adopt `deletedAt` or keep `isDeleted` but standardize.
  - Update all queries to filter out deleted entries by default.
  - Ensure admin tools can still view/delete/restore as needed.

### 2.4 Data seeding for dev and tests

- Implement `prisma/seed.ts` aligned with spec:
  - Create:
    - 1–2 test tenants, with full `settings`, `branding`, `permissions`.
    - At least one Super Admin user.
    - At least one regular user who is:
      - A member of a test tenant.
      - A non-member to test access controls.
    - Sample posts, events, volunteer needs, small groups, donations, contact submissions.
  - Ensure IDs/slugs/emails used in tests (`test-suite/*`) correspond to seeded entities.
- Add commands:
  - `npm run db:reset` (drop, migrate, seed).
  - `npm run db:seed` (seed only).

### 2.5 Indexing and performance planning

- Add indexes for common access patterns:
  - `User.email` (unique).
  - `UserTenantMembership.userId`, `tenantId`, combined indexes.
  - `Post.tenantId`, `Event.tenantId`, `DonationRecord.tenantId`.
  - Messaging: `ConversationParticipant.userId`, `ChatMessage.conversationId`.
  - Notifications: `Notification.userId`, `createdAt`.
- Before adding complex features (leaderboards, large lists):
  - Confirm queries use indexed fields and avoid N+1 patterns (plan for future Postgres).

---

## 3. Auth, Sessions & NextAuth

### 3.1 NextAuth configuration

- Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` are correctly configured (see `.env`).
- Verify `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`:
  - Uses `Credentials` provider (and/or OAuth providers as needed) with bcrypt for password verification.
  - Properly maps Prisma `User` to NextAuth session.
  - Ensures no password or sensitive fields are returned in the session.

### 3.2 Registration flows

- Implement or verify `POST /api/auth/register`:
  - Validates input (email, password, displayName) via Zod.
  - Uses `bcrypt.hash` before storing passwords.
  - Creates `User`, `UserProfile`, `AccountSettings`, `UserPrivacySettings`.
  - Returns a structured JSON response: `{ success: boolean, error?: string }`.
  - Logs an audit event `ActionType.USER_REGISTERED`.
- Ensure registration UI:
  - Uses this API (not old mock functions).
  - Shows clear error messages for:
    - Email already exists.
    - Invalid password.
    - Validation errors.

### 3.3 Login, logout, session

- Confirm login:
  - Uses NextAuth `signIn('credentials', ...)`.
  - Handles known errors (wrong password, unknown email) with user-friendly messages.
- Confirm logout:
  - Uses NextAuth `signOut`.
  - Clears session cookies cleanly.
- Implement/verify `/api/auth/me`:
  - Returns:
    - Current user profile.
    - Global role (Super Admin or not).
    - Tenant memberships (IDs, roles).
  - Returns 401 when not authenticated.
  - Used by tests and by client-side code when needed.

### 3.4 Password reset

- Implement `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`:
  - Accepts email.
  - Generates secure token stored in DB (e.g., `PasswordResetToken` model).
  - Sends email using planned email service (see Section 10).
- Implement `POST /api/auth/reset-password`:
  - Accepts token and new password.
  - Validates token, checks expiration.
  - Updates password using bcrypt.
  - Invalidates token.
  - Returns appropriate error codes for invalid/expired tokens.

### 3.5 Impersonation with NextAuth

- Design impersonation model:
  - E.g., `ImpersonationSession` table or session fields:
    - `realUserId` (platform admin).
    - `effectiveUserId` (impersonated user).
- Implement server-side logic:
  - `getServerSession` wrapper that understands impersonation.
  - All route handlers and server components should use this wrapper to get both real and effective user.
- Ensure:
  - Only Super Admin can start impersonation.
  - Audit logs record start and end events.
  - UI shows an impersonation banner and a way to exit impersonation.

---

## 4. Permissions & Tenant Isolation

### 4.1 Centralize permission checking

- Review `lib/permissions.ts`:
  - Ensure `can(user, tenant, action)` and `hasRole(...)`:
    - Accept Prisma-backed types or a normalized DTO.
    - Cover all actions described in `projectplan.md` (posts, events, donations, prayer wall, resources, moderation).
  - Add clear enum or string union for actions (e.g., `'canApproveMembership'`, `'canBanMembers'`, `'canManagePrayerWall'` etc.).
- Add tests for `permissions.ts`:
  - For each role (`MEMBER`, `STAFF`, `CLERGY`, `MODERATOR`, `ADMIN`) and each `TenantRoleType`.
  - For super admin override behavior.
  - For feature toggles (e.g., if `enablePrayerWall` is false, deny related actions).

### 4.2 Tenant resolution & isolation

- Implement a shared helper `getTenantContext`:
  - Given a tenant ID or slug:
    - Loads tenant + settings + branding + permissions.
    - Validates that the current effective user has the right to access this tenant.
  - Used by:
    - Tenant routes (e.g., `app/tenants/[tenantId]/...`).
    - Tenant-scoped APIs (`/api/tenants/[tenantId]/...`).
- Ensure every tenant-scoped API:
  - Validates membership status:
    - Non-member access limited to public content.
    - Banned or rejected users blocked from certain actions.
  - Honors `isPublic` flag and `visitorVisibility`.

### 4.3 UI-level permission enforcement

- Audit navigation in `TenantLayout` and tenant pages:
  - Only show “Settings”, “Donations”, “Volunteering”, “Small Groups”, “Live Stream”, “Prayer Wall”, “Resources” links when:
    - Feature is enabled (`TenantSettings.enableX === true`).
    - User has permission (admin or specific capabilities via `can`).
- Add UI-level fallbacks:
  - If user navigates directly to a page they cannot access:
    - Show an “Access Denied” message, not a crash.
    - Optionally, link back to home.

---

## 5. API Routes by Domain

> Many functions exist in `lib/data.ts` as TODO stubs. These should be replaced by a real service layer + API routes. Below is the desired API surface and behavior.

### 5.1 Auth & Account

- Add routes for:
  - `PATCH /api/account/profile` – updates `UserProfile`.
  - `PATCH /api/account/privacy` – updates `UserPrivacySettings`.
  - `PATCH /api/account/settings` – updates `AccountSettings`.
- Ensure each route:
  - Validates payload with Zod.
  - Uses permission helper to ensure only current user (or super admin) can update profile.
  - Returns clear JSON error structures on failure.

### 5.2 Tenants & Search

- Implement:
  - `GET /api/tenants` – list tenants (with basic filters/search).
  - `POST /api/tenants` – create tenant:

---

## 6. Front-End Pages & Feature Integration

### 6.1 App Router structure sanity check

- Audit `app/` directory:
  - Ensure all major routes exist and match spec:
    - Landing page.
    - Auth pages (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`).
    - Explore/search.
    - Tenant public page.
    - Tenant dashboard pages (home, posts, events, members, chat, donations, volunteering, small groups, live stream, prayer wall, resources, contact, control panel).
    - Global messages page.
    - Admin console.
- Confirm route params:
  - For tenant routes, decide on `[tenantId]` vs `[slug]` and keep consistent.
  - Update links and tests accordingly.

### 6.2 Migrate UI from mock data to real APIs

- For each feature area:
  - Replace direct calls to `lib/data.ts` stubs with `fetch` calls or server actions backed by real APIs.
  - Remove any leftover mock-only imports or data.
- Ensure server components:
  - Use `getServerSession` and `getTenantContext` to load data.
  - Handle loading and error states gracefully.

### 6.3 Error, loading, and empty states

- For each major page:
  - Add explicit `loading` state component where applicable (e.g., `loading.tsx`).
  - Add `error` boundary or pattern:
    - Show descriptive message when API fails.
  - Add “empty” states:
    - No posts, no events, no donations, no volunteer needs, no small groups, no messages, etc.

---

## 7. Testing & Test Suite Integration

### 7.1 Make test environment deterministic

- Ensure `run-tests` scripts:
  - Run migrations and seed DB before tests.
  - Use a different database file or schema for tests.
- Ensure test config:
  - Uses consistent base URL (`NEXTAUTH_URL`, dev server port).
  - Has stable credentials for known test users/tenants.

### 7.2 Fix currently failing and skipped tests

- Analyze `test-results/`:
  - Identify recurring failures (e.g., 401s due to missing session, 404s due to missing routes, missing test tenant).
  - Create concrete tasks per failure to either:
    - Implement missing endpoint/feature.
    - Adjust test to match correct behavior.
- Unskip tests that were skipped due to missing data:
  - After seeding tenants and users, re-enable membership, permissions, and control-panel tests.

### 7.3 Add unit & integration tests

- Permissions:
  - Unit tests for `can`, `hasRole` for all relevant actions/roles.
- API routes:
  - Integration tests (supertest or similar) for:
    - Auth.
    - Tenants.
    - Membership.
    - Content.
    - Events.
    - Messaging.
    - Donations.
- UI behavior:
  - If using Playwright or similar:
    - E2E flows: register → login → create tenant → join → post → event → message.

---

## 8. Error Handling, Logging & Observability

### 8.1 Standardize error responses

- Create a helper for API route error handling:
  - Wrap handlers in try/catch.
  - Log details on the server.
  - Return `{ error: string; code?: string }` with appropriate HTTP status.
- Ensure:
  - Validation errors → 400.
  - Unauthenticated → 401.
  - Unauthorized → 403.
  - Not found → 404.
  - Unexpected errors → 500.

### 8.2 Audit logging

- Implement an `audit.ts` helper:
  - Functions like `logAuditEvent({ actorUserId, effectiveUserId, actionType, entityType, entityId, metadata })`.
  - Writes to `AuditLog` with Prisma.
- Hook audit logging into:
  - User registration, login (if needed).
  - Tenant creation and updates.
  - Membership status/role changes.
  - Impersonation start/end.
  - Donation settings changes.
  - Deletions of content/messages.

### 8.3 Application logging & monitoring

- Introduce a simple logging interface:
  - Wrap `console.log`/`console.error` with a structured logger.
  - Include context: user ID, tenant ID, route, correlation ID when available.
- Optionally:
  - Add integration points for external monitoring (e.g., Sentry, OpenTelemetry), behind a feature flag or environment config.

## 9. Security & Hardening

### 9.1 Password & credential safety

- Ensure:
  - All password operations use bcrypt with an appropriate cost factor.
  - Passwords are never logged or returned from APIs.
  - Password reset tokens are:
    - Random, long, single-use.
    - Expire after a short time.
- Consider:
  - Rate limiting login attempts per IP/user.
  - Account lockout after repeated failures (or at least logging and alerting).

### 9.2 Tenant isolation & data leakage

- Audit all Prisma queries:
  - Ensure tenant-scoped operations always include `where: { tenantId: currentTenantId }`.
  - Avoid global queries that might leak cross-tenant data.
- Verify:
  - Members of one tenant cannot access other tenants’ private data.
  - Super Admin behavior is explicit and traced.

### 9.3 Input validation & sanitization

- Use Zod schemas for all incoming data:
  - Auth, tenant creation, posts, events, donations, resource uploads, contact submissions, messaging.
- Sanitize:
  - User-supplied HTML or rich text (posts, messages) if rendered as HTML (prevent XSS).
- Validate:
  - Allowed file types in Resource Center.
  - URL formats for streams, donation links, etc.

## 10. UX Resilience & Accessibility

### 10.1 Anonymous vs authenticated flows

- Ensure:
  - Public pages are accessible without login and show “Log in / Join” affordances.
  - Auth-only pages redirect to `/auth/login` if unauthenticated (tested in `page-tests.ts`).
- Fix edge cases:
  - Stale links to settings or messages behave gracefully (redirect or show info).

### 10.2 User-friendly error messaging

- Replace generic “Something went wrong” with:
  - Clear context (“We couldn’t save your donation settings”, “You don’t have permission to view this page”).
  - Next steps (try again, contact admin).
- Propagate API error messages:
  - UI forms should show validation errors from API in-line.

### 10.3 Accessibility

- Review:
  - Navigation (tab focus order, ARIA roles).
  - Modal dialogs (focus trapping, ARIA labels).
  - Form controls (labels, descriptions, error messages).
- Ensure:
  - Color contrast meets WCAG AA.
  - All key actions can be performed via keyboard only.

## 11. Developer Experience & Documentation

### 11.1 Local dev workflow

- Document:
  - How to set up `.env` and `.env.local`.
  - Commands: `npm install`, `npx prisma migrate dev`, `npm run dev`, `npm run test`.
- Ensure:
  - Windows compatibility (`.bat` scripts already exist—validate and update as needed).
  - Documentation for Node version and any global tools.

### 11.2 Keep specs and implementation in sync

- Update:
  - `backend.md` to reflect actual services and APIs.
  - `projectplan.md` to mark phases as truly complete or partially complete based on real implementation.
  - `test-suite/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` and related docs to describe current gaps and priorities.
- Add:
  - A “Known Deviations from Spec” section to capture deliberate changes vs. plan.

### 11.3 Onboarding checklist for new developers

- Create a short section in `README.md`:
  - “If you’re new to Temple, do this first”:
    - Set env vars.
    - Run migrations.
    - Seed DB.
    - Start dev server.
    - Run test suite.
  - List key entry points:
    - Auth routes.
    - Tenant routes.
    - Control panel.
    - Admin console.
